# Notion as A Content Management System

## Getting started

To run locally, you first need to clone and install the project with Node.js and npm, and it will need to be a newer version like `node@18.17.0` or higher. You can download Node.js and npm [here](https://nodejs.org).

In terminal, run the following from your desired root folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/techtheriac/next-notion-cms-workshop.git

cd gifted_austin

npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
